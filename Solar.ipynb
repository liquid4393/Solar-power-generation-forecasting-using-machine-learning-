This should include solar radiation/sunlight intensity, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and any other weather parameters that might influence solar power generation. Crucially, acquire data specifically for the year 2024, focusing on data points around sunrise hours. If possible, obtain historical solar power generation data from a solar plant in the area, along with details on the solar panel efficiency, number of panels, and total solar capacity of the plant."
